# Verilator-compatible testbench for the HPDcache block

This is a Verilator-compatible (with SystemC) testbench for the HPDcache block.

It is a standalone testbench where the HPDcache is not connected to a processor
core. Requests are generated by agents using a sequence defined by the user.
Some sequences are already provided in the sequence_lib subdirectory.

The testbench also implements a memory response model that acts as the main
memory of the system.

All the requests and responses to/from the HPDcache are validated automatically
by the testbench scoreboard.

## Prerequisites

This testbench requires the following tools and libraries pre-installed:

- Verilator
- SystemC library (version 2.3.4 or newer)
- Perl (version 5 or newer)

You need to set the following environment variables (bash: export, csh: setenv):

- HPDCACHE_DIR : it should contain the path to the root of the hpdcache repository
- SYSTEMC_LIBDIR : it should point to the libdir directory of the SystemC
                   library installation

You also need to add the "script" subdirectory to the Perl Library Path:

- PERL5LIB = ${PERL5LIB}:${PWD}/script/perl5

## Usage

Show the help message of the testbench:
```bash
$ make help
```
